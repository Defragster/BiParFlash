49.2.1 Port Data Output Register (GPIOx_PDOR) 
This register configures the logic levels that are driven on each general-purpose output pins.
Unimplemented pins for a particular device read as zero.
0 Logic level 0 is driven on pin, provided pin is configured for general-purpose output. 
1 Logic level 1 is driven on pin, provided pin is configured for general-purpose output

49.2.2 Port Set Output Register (GPIOx_PSOR) 
This register configures whether to set the fields of the PDOR.
Writing to this register will update the contents of the corresponding bit in the PDOR as follows:
0 Corresponding bit in PDORn does not change. 
1 Corresponding bit in PDORn is set to logic 1.

49.2.3 Port Clear Output Register (GPIOx_PCOR) 
This register configures whether to clear the fields of PDOR.
Writing to this register will update the contents of the corresponding bit in the Port Data Output Register (PDOR) as follows:
0 Corresponding bit in PDORn does not change. 
1 Corresponding bit in PDORn is cleared to logic 0.

49.2.4 Port Toggle Output Register (GPIOx_PTOR)
Writing to this register will update the contents of the corresponding bit in the PDOR as follows:
0 Corresponding bit in PDORn does not change. 
1 Corresponding bit in PDORn is set to the inverse of its existing logic state.

49.2.5 Port Data Input Register (GPIOx_PDIR)
Reads 0 at the unimplemented pins for a particular device. Pins that are not configured for a digital function read 0. If the Port Control and Interrupt module is disabled, then the corresponding bit in PDIR does not update.
0 Pin logic level is logic 0, or is not configured for use by digital function. 
1 Pin logic level is logic 1.

49.2.6 Port Data Direction Register (GPIOx_PDDR) 
The PDDR configures the individual port pins for input or output.
Configures individual port pins for input or output.
0 Pin is configured as general-purpose input, for the GPIO function. 
1 Pin is configured as general-purpose output, for the GPIO function.
